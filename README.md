# hdmpy

The hdmpy package is a Python port of parts of the R package [hdm](https://github.com/cran/hdm). All credit for the original package goes to the authors of hdm, all mistakes are my own. This project is in its very early stages and documentation is virtually nonexistent, so use it at your own risk.

## Installation
To install this package, such that you can import it into Python using ``import hdmpy as hdm`` for example, simply clone the repo. Then, add the path you cloned it into to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
